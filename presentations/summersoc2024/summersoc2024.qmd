## Cloud-Edge Continuum

## Motivation (1)

*"I'm a researcher and I have developed a sophisticated **service placement** strategy. I tested it in a **simulated environment** with iFogSim2 and it reduced the overall **resource utilization** by 30% and improved the **average response time** perceived by a couple of clients by 20% compared to the baseline".*

So far so good.

## Motivation (2) {.smaller}

*"Now I want to test it in a real cloud-edge infrastructure. I want a tool that supports the lifecycle of **creating** the infrastructure, **operate** my applications, **monitors** devices and applications, and helps with **evaluation** and **documentation** for my scientific publication."*  
Documentation is essential for reproducibility

- Topology (type of *Nodes*, *Links* between nodes)
- Condition of the network links (round-trip time and bandwidth)
- Monitoring configuration (kind of metrics, sampling rate, etc.)
- Resource allocation and service placement

Any Recommendations?

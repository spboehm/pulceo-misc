## Task Scheduling / Offloading {.smaller}

![](figures/task-offloading.drawio.svg)


- IoT / mobile clients, submitting set of independent / atomic tasks $T$
- Heterogeneous cloud, edge and fog nodes $N$
- Tasks $T$ and nodes $N$ are described by 
  - Properties $P$: Layer, Location, Costs, ... 
  - Requirements $R$: CPU, memory, bandwidth, ...

## Motivation

::: columns
::: {.column width="60%"}

Many solutions exist for **task scheduling / offloading / resource allocation**

But, similar to the provision model of service placement: Limited

- **Reproducibility**
- (General) **Applicability**

is because of:

- **simulation-based** evaluations
- **custom** implementations
- missing **real-world experiments**

Prevalent are:

- iFogSim / iFogSim2
- Local, custom Applications
- Solvers

Only 3 out of 36 task offloading strategies were using real-world implementations and evaluations.[^1]

## Simulations are sufficient?

Selected limitations, addressed by the **authors** of task offloading / scheduling solutions:

> Where the value of **CPU weight** and **memory weight** is an **empirical issue**, and **multiple experiments are required** to obtain the optimal value such that α + β = 1. In this paper, all parameters are set to appropriate values.[^1]

> Phare [the scheduling solution] requires updated information on the clusters participating in the federation,
including **CPU**, **memory**, and **bandwidth usage**. A **real-world implementation** should thus **carefully balance** the resolution of such data and the additional overhead required to process it.[^2]

Consequently, there is a need for real-world experiments.

# Contributions

Four major contributions

1. Integrating task scheduling and offloading into our holistic cloud-edge orchestration life cycle.
2. A general, universal, and flexible model of tasks, implemented in a publicly available software prototype.
3. Seamless technical integration of already available task-processing applications.
4. A set of standard evaluation metrics for task scheduling and offloading, automatically provided by our
platform.

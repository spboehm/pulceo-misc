## Motivation

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
**Edge computing:** Placing of computational resources close to end-users.

Many solutions exist for **task scheduling / offloading / resource allocation**

But, limited

-   **Reproducibility**
-   (General) **Applicability**

because of

-   **custom** implementations
-   missing **real-world experiments**

Simulations are prevalent: only 19 out of 99 solutions used a small test-bed.[^1]

# Contributions

Four major contributions

1. Integrating task scheduling and offloading into our holistic cloud-edge orchestration life cycle.
2. A general, universal, and flexible model of tasks that is implemented in a publicly available software prototype.
3. Seamless technical integration of already available task-processing applications.
4. A set of standard evaluation metrics for task scheduling and offloading, automatically provided by our
platform.

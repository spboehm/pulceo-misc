# Resources

All resources with their required attributes are stored in CSV files.

The first three columns of all CSV are the following:

- `ID`: Identifies a particular paper, integer. 
- `Author`: The author(s) of a particular paper, string.
- `Year`: The year of the publication,  integer.

All other columns follow the schema `Attribute` (Example: Location) or `Attribute_Specialization` (Example: Location_GPS).

Only two characteristics attributes are possible:

- `y`: Means "yes", in terms of **used** or **required**.
- `n`: Means "no", in terms of **not used** or **not required**.
